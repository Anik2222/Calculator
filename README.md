**Basic Calculator Program**
This repository contains a simple C program that functions as a basic calculator. The program performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

**Overview**
The **Basic Calculator** is a console-based application that allows the user to input two numbers and an operator to perform basic arithmetic operations. The supported operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Features**
**Arithmetic Operations:** The program supports the following operations:
Addition (**+**)
Subtraction (**-**)
Multiplication (*)
Division (**/**)
**User Input:** The user inputs an operator and two numbers, and the program outputs the result of the operation.
**Error Handling:** If an unsupported operator is entered, the program will display an error message.

**How to Use**
Run the program in a C environment or IDE that supports console applications.
The program will prompt you to:
Enter an operator (**+, -, *, /**)
Enter two numbers (operands)
The program will then display the result of the operation based on the input.
If an unsupported operator is entered, the program will print an error message.

**Requirements**
C compiler (e.g., GCC)
Basic understanding of C programming
Running the Program
Compile the program using a C compiler.
Run the compiled executable in a terminal or command prompt.
Follow the on-screen prompts to input the operator and operands.

**Example Usage**
**Input: +, 5.5, 2.0**
**Output: 5.5 + 2.0 = 7.5**
